In my IT career I have acquired a broad knowledge in many areas of enterprise IT. 
I enjoy the design, setup and operation of complex IT systems. 
My focus is on fail-safe, scalable and adaptable IT without losing sight of the costs. 
I combine existing solutions with new technology, which Iâ€™m always open to.
